# Game title: FistFire

## Introduction

FistFire is a prototype game made to solidify and showcase the skills I acquired while learning unity. It serves as a milestone in my learning journey as a game developer.

## Description

FistFire is a first person rouge-lite game based around creating projectiles and punching them in a desired direction to defeat numerous enemies and bosses. Each run you find yourself in a randomly generated environement. To progress further you have to find a few pilars to begin a bossfight leading you to the next level. Through each run you can collect numerous items altering your stats, changing the behavoiur of your projectiles and even add whole new abilities.

## Gameplay highlights

* Strategical projectile placement: In this unique world your fists are your biggest weapons, yet using them directly does enemies no harm. You have to strategically place the projectiles and use them to crush your foes.
* Dynamic environements: Every playthrough of FistFire presents you with unique randomly generated environements, ensuring that no two runs areever the same.
* Conquer the Pillars: To progress to the next level, you must locate and conquer the mysterious pillars that guard the path. Prepare for epic boss battles that will test your skills to the limit.
* Pickups: You have to expand your arsenal with multiple collectable items to o stand a chance against powerful enemies.
* Permadeath: Each time you die you have to start over, use the skills you acquired and collect items you unlocked in your previous run to advance further than the last time.

## Current roadmap
