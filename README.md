# Game title: FistFire

## Introduction

FistFire is a prototype game made to solidify and showcase the skills I acquired while learning unity. It serves as a milestone in my learning journey as a game developer. I won't be focusing on level design, etc. for now as I'm mainly focusing on programming.

## Description

FistFire is a first person rouge-lite game based around creating projectiles and punching them in a desired direction to defeat numerous enemies and bosses. Each run you find yourself in a randomly selected environement. To progress further you have to defeat numerous waves of enemies and a bossfight at the end. Through each run you can collect numerous items altering your stats, changing the behavoiur of your projectiles.

## Gameplay highlights

* Strategical projectile placement: In this unique world your fists are your biggest weapons, yet using them directly does enemies no harm. You have to strategically place the projectiles and use them to crush your foes.
* Dynamic environements: Every playthrough of FistFire presents you with unique randomly selected environements, ensuring that no two runs areever the same.
* Pickups: You have to expand your arsenal with multiple collectable items to o stand a chance against powerful enemies.
* Permadeath: Each time you die you have to start over, use the skills you acquired anutilize them in your next run to advance further/faster than the last time.
